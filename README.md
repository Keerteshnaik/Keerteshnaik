# Hi there 🙋🏻‍♂️, It's me KEERTESH NAIK

Am an **Cybersecurity** student! Presently pursuing my bachelor degree at SUIET.  

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer networks and user data from unauthorized access or theft. A good cybersecurity student is one who takes the time to learn about the latest threats and how to protect against them. They also have a strong understanding of the importance of data security and take steps to ensure that their own data and the data of others is protected. So being an **Cybersecurity** student I want to explore new things to become an good engineer.
